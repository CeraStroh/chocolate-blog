Check out the blog at https://chocolate-blog.vercel.app/. 
 
A blog for my LAS Chocolate class (Behind Bars: Revealing Chocolate's Bitter Sweetness) at Central College based on the Next.js tutorial at [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

Ran `npm install -g npm@latest` when I couldn't create a Next.js app.

You must be in the nextjs-blog directory to `npm run dev`.
